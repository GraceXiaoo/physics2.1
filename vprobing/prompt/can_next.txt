Based on the given problem description and solution, please decide whether parameter A in the variable list can be computed in the next solution sentence (namely, its predecessors have all been calculated). Note that A might not be necessary to answer the question.

Output requirements: Please only output data formats that can be parsed by Python's json.loads() function, similar to:
[
    {{
        "variable":"xxx",
        "judgement":1/0
    }},
    {{
        "variable":"xxx",
        "judgement":1/0
    }}
]
Where the value of judgement is 1 or 0, 1 means parameter can be computed in the next solution sentence, and 0 means not . Be careful not to output other content.

Problem description: {problem}
Variable List: {var}
