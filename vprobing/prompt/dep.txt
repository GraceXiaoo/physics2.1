Given a problem description, determine whether the left-hand parameter A of each parameter pair in the variable list (recursively) depends on the right-hand parameter B. Parameter dependency means that the value of B must be known before A can be calculated.

Output requirements: Please only output data formats that can be parsed by Python's json.loads() function, similar to:
[
    {{
        "variable":["A","B"],
        "judgement":1/0
    }},
    {{
        "variable":["A","B"],
        "judgement":1/0
    }}
]
Where the value of judgement is 1 or 0, 1 means A depends on B, 0 means A does not depend on B. Be careful not to output other content.
Problem description: {problem}
Variable List: {var}

Please perform the task according to the above requirements.
